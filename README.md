# dungeon-rescue
A classic gun-based roguelite dungeon crawler similar to Binding of Isaac.
My game will be a top-down roguelite game with randomly generated dungeons where the player will have to navigate through the floors, killing enemies with different types of weapons. The weapons will NOT have a description, like in the Binding of Isaac, so players will need to figure out how they work by using them. When you kill enemies, they have a chance to drop souls, which you keep after you die and can be used to upgrade stats such as max health. Everything else you pick up along the way, you will lose. The educational element of the game is persistence. Everytime you die, the game will convey this message to you.
